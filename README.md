# Akkoma

[Akkoma](https://akkoma.social/) is a federated social networking platform, compatible with GNU social and other OStatus implementations. It is free software licensed under the AGPLv3.

It actually consists of two components: a backend, named simply Akkoma, and various frontends which can be installed. It's main advantages are its lightness and speed.

This setup is heavily based on https://github.com/angristan/docker-pleroma, which tweaks and changes needed to use Akkoma instead.

## Features

- Based on the elixir:alpine image
- Ran as an unprivileged user
- It works great

Sadly, this is not a reusable (e.g. I can't upload it to the Docker Hub), because for now Akkoma needs to compile the configuration. ðŸ˜¢
Thus you will need to build the image yourself, but I explain how to do it below.

## Build-time variables

- **`AKKOMA_VER`** : Akkoma version (latest commit of the [`stable` branch](https://akkoma.dev/AkkomaGang/akkoma) by default)
- **`GID`**: group id (default: `911`)
- **`UID`**: user id (default: `911`)

## Usage

### Installation

Create a folder for your Akoma instance. Inside, you should have the `build` folder, `docker-compose.yml` and `db.env` from this repo.

#### 1. Create folders

Create the various folders needed, and set ownership of the folders. The values should match the `UID` and `GID` used to build the image. Feel free to change the location of these folders, just remember to update the `docker-compose.yml` file too.

``` sh
mkdir uploads config static
chown -R 911:911 uploads config static
```

#### 2. Enable citext extension

Akkoma uses the `citext` PostgreSQL extension, here is how to add it:

```sh
docker-compose up -d db
docker exec -i akkoma_db psql -U akkoma -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext;"
docker-compose down
```

#### 3. (Optional) Configure Akkoma

Optionally configure Akkoma, see [Config Override](#config-override).

#### 4. Build the image and launch!

You can now build the image:

``` sh
docker-compose build
```

You can now launch your instance:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

The initial creation of the database schema will be done automatically. Check if everything went well with:

```sh
docker logs -f akkoma_web
```

#### 5. Create admin user

Make a new admin user using docker exec (replace fakeadmin with any username you'd like):

``` sh
docker exec -it akkoma_web sh ./bin/pleroma_ctl user new fakeadmin admin@test.net --admin
```

At this point if you connect to Akkoma, you should hopefully see a page which tells you to install a frontend. You can install the default frontend by running:

``` sh
docker exec -it akkoma_web sh ./bin/pleroma_ctl frontend install pleroma-fe
```

You can now setup a reverse proxy in a container or on your host by using the [example Nginx config](https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/blob/develop/installation/pleroma.nginx).

### Update

By default, the Dockerfile will be built from the latest commit of the `stable` branch.

Thus to update, just rebuild your image and recreate your containers:

```sh
docker-compose pull # update the PostgreSQL if needed
docker-compose build .
docker-compose run --rm web mix ecto.migrate # migrate the database if needed
docker-compose up -d # recreate the containers if needed
```

If you want to run a specific commit, you can use the `AKKOMA_VER` variable:

```sh
docker build -t pleroma . --build-arg AKKOMA_VER=develop # a branch
docker build -t pleroma . --build-arg AKKOMA_VER=a9203ab3 # a commit
docker build -t pleroma . --build-arg AKKOMA_VER=v3.4.0 # a version
```

This value can also be set through `docker-compose.yml` as seen in the example file provided in this repository.

## Config

### Config override

For those that want to change and tweak Akkoma's any configuration properties which are are not exposed through environment variables, there is the option to provide your own `/config/config.exs`. This `config.exs` will be read by the default config setup, and any values you set in this file will override the default setup.

### Secrets

By default, keys and secrets used for encryption will be generated for you, and stored in `/config/secret.exs`. There's nothing you need to do here, but if you wish to customize the values you can modify this file as required.
